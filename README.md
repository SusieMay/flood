#Flood Simulation
This project is a flood simulation that visualizes how water spreads across a terrain map, allowing users to interact with the environment. It is built using Python, Pygame, and Pillow. The simulation reads terrain data from an image, simulates flooding, and provides an interactive interface to manipulate terrain and water flow.

Key Features:
Terrain Map: The terrain is derived from an image, with specific colors representing different types of land (e.g., water, terrain, flooded terrain).

Flood Simulation: Water spreads dynamically based on terrain and neighboring water cells, simulating realistic flooding behavior.

Interactive Tools: Users can apply different tools (dam, water, terrain, eraser) to modify the environment.

Simulation Controls: Includes sliders for adjusting opacity and flow speed, and an option to toggle satellite imagery.

Real-time Visualization: The simulation runs at 60 FPS and updates in real-time, with terrain colors and water depth changing based on the simulation state.
